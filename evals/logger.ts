 *
 * The `parseLogLine` function helps transform raw `LogLine` objects into a more
 * structured format (`LogLineEval`), making auxiliary data easier to understand
 * and analyze. By associating an `EvalLogger` instance with a `Stagehand` object,
 * all logs emitted during the evaluation process can be captured, persisted, and
 * reviewed after the tasks complete.
